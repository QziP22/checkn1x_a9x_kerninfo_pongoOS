See release for ISO.

The following is copied from odysseyn1x readme, you should use [their instructions](https://github.com/asdfugil/odysseyn1x/blob/master/README.md).

Make an iCloud/iTunes backup before using odysseyn1x, so that you can go back if something goes wrong.

The amd64 iso is for 64-bit CPUs (AMD and Intel) and the i686 one is for 32-bit CPUs. If you are unsure which one to download, the amd64 ISO will work in most cases.

Download an .iso here.
Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). If you prefer Rufus, make sure to select GPT partition and DD image mode otherwise it won't work.
Open balenaEtcher and write the .iso you downloaded to your USB drive.
Reboot, enter your BIOS's boot menu and select the USB drive.
